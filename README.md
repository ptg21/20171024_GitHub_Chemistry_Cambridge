## Overview

Are you interested in learning Git and GitHub to manage your code, manuscripts or research data? This introductory workshop will be covering the following:

- [Background and motivation](README.md#background-and-motivation)
- [What is Git? What is version control? What is GitHub?](README.md#what-is-git-what-is-version-control-what-is-github)
- [How can Git and GitHub be useful for you?](README.md#how-can-git-and-github-be-useful-for-you)
- [Practical session: working with Git and GitHub](README.md#practical-working-with-git-and-github)


## Background and motivation

- *A system to keep track and compare the history of changes made to your files (versions)*

- *A platform to share and showcase your work online with colleagues and beyond*

- *Team work often means unnecessary work for some:*
  - Many people working on the same file at the same time (you, your lab colleague, your group leader, collaborators abroad ...).
  - Multiple versions of it (e.g. research manuscript, computer script ...).

## What is Git? What is version control? What is GitHub?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a **free and open source** *distributed version control system*, which allows you to:

- Create repositories to host your projects using the [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
- Track changes in the files and folders within your repositories.


Version control systems were originally created by groups writing software and code (e.g. Linux project), but can be used for any kind of files or projects.

</p>

Advantages of *distributed* over *centralised* version control systems involve:
- If the central repository (server) crashes, it could be recovered / backed up from any of the local repositories created by the researcher, collaborator or group leader.
- Each person can make changes to their local repositories *offline*. Then integrate their individual changes in the central repository (server) when connected *online*.

[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is a web platform that allows you to upload and manage your local or central repositories online (Hub). It provides:

- A backup of your repositories
- A nice visual interface to your repositories
- A way to collaborate with others

Changes are identified by a *revision number*, e.g. 60363b1. Each revision is associated with a *timestamp* and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

There are other softwares for version control, e.g. subversion ([svn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion)).


### Interfaces to Git and GitHub

- Via the command-line using *git*

<p align="center">
<img src=images/git_commandline.png width="600">
</p>

- Directly [online](http://github.com/)

<p align="center">
<img src=images/github_online.png width="800">
</p>

- Github [Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (available for Mac and Windows)

<p align="center">
<img src=images/github_desktop.png width="800">
</p>

<p align="right">
(https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
</p>

For this workshop, we are mainly using GitHub's online interface, but also some command-line.


### Public (free) and private repositories

A user has to create a GitHub account in order to create repositories:

- Public repositories are free, and can be browsed and downloaded by anyone.
- Private repositories have associated costs - see [pricing of plans](https://github.com/pricing). The developer plan costs $7/month but it is free if you are a [student / academic](https://education.github.com/pack).

There are alternatives to GitHub, e.g. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), which works similarly but uses a different strategy with free private repositories and cost plans for public ones. Other alternatives: [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).


### Markdown

GitHub uses Markdown, a language with plain text formatting syntax, to render pages online. See examples of Markdown syntax [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).



## How can Git and GitHub be useful for you?

### Some examples

These are many ways how people use Git and GitHub.

- To host and share your research outputs, software or training materials
  - Research slides by [Bérénice Batut](https://bebatut-slides.github.io/backofen_lab_retreat_04_17/#/).
  - The Balasubramanian laboratory [computational projects](https://github.com/sblab-bioinformatics).
  - The Bender group [GitHub page](https://github.com/BenderGroup).
  - The source code of the BWA software, which aligns DNA sequences to reference genomes, is available [here](https://github.com/lh3/bwa).
  - The source code of the PIDGIN software, which predicts protein targets for drug-like molecules, is available [here](https://github.com/lhm30/PIDGINv2).

- To create websites
  - Using [GitHub pages]((https://pages.github.com/)) to create your personal research [website](http://mikelove.github.io/).
  - To distribute information about your courses and activities, e.g. the Statistics course in the University of British Columbia is hosted [here](http://stat545.com/index.html).
  
- To share the contents of a book
  - The Bioinformatics Data Skills [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do) shares materials in a dedicated GitHub [page](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files).


### In the context of our research group

- Most projects have both an experimental and a computational leader
- Classical ways of sharing are: conversations/meetings, email, DropBox, common/shared folders ...
- An environment where:
  - Computational colleagues can share code and results, review work of others and get credit from their collaborative project work.
  - Experimental colleagues can follow development, access computational results and learn methods of data analysis.

- Reproducibility in computational research to avoid situations like ...

<p align="center">
<img src=images/p2_4.png width="800">
</p>

- You created your first repository! :rocket:



### Explore your first repository and GitHub account

#### Your first repository

- Click on **README.md** and go to the middle-right pencil "Edit this file". Type anything to change the file, e.g. "GitHub is fun!".

<p align="center">
<img src=images/p3_1.png width="800">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src=images/p3_2.png width="800">
</p>

- Scroll down. Introduce a commit change message, e.g. "My first update", and select the radio button "Commit directly to the master branch". Then click on "Commit changes". Voilá!

<p align="center">
<img src=images/p3_3.png width="800">
</p>

- To view your **history of commits** for **README.md**, click on **README.md** and go to the middle-right "History" button.
- Alternatively, to view your **history of commits** for your first repository, click on the name of your repository and select the tab depicting a small clock and the number of commits next to it.

Bonus points:

- Try to create a new file
- In your new repository, have a look at the "Settings" tab, explore "Collaborators" and try to add the person sitting next to you.


#### Your GitHub account

- Click on your top-right "avatar" icon and select "Settings".

<p align="center">
<img src=images/p3_4.png width="800">
</p>

- Explore the tabs "Profile", "Account" and "Emails".



### Making changes using Git in the command-line

#### Check if Git is already installed in your computer, otherwise install Git

- (If in Mac), go to *Finder* -> *Applications* -> *Utilities* -> *Terminal* and type `git --version`. 
  - If you get as output something like `git version 2.5.4 (Apple Git-61)`, then Git is already installed -> Jump to the next section.
  - If you get something around `git: command not found`, keep reading.

- To install Git in Mac, follow one of the next strategies:
  1. When running one of the following commands `git --version`, `git config` or `xcode-select --install` you may be offered to install developer command line tools. Accept the offer and follow with "Install".
  2. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download git. Double click on the downloaded executable and follow instructions.
  3. If you have `homebrew` installed, type the following in the Terminal: `brew install git`.
  
- Check the following for installing in [Windows](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#windows) or [Linux](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#linux).


#### Tell git who you are (your GitHub username) and what your email address is

Example:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git config --global user.name "githubchemistry"
git config --global user.email "sm848@cam.ac.uk"
```

Check:

```bash
git config --list
```


#### Clone the repository created before

```bash
git clone https://github.com/githubchemistry/my_first_repository.git
cd my_first_repository
ls -lh
#-rw-r--r--  1 martin03  1310    38B 24 Oct 09:16 README.md
```

Your first repository created using GitHub is now a local repository located in your Desktop folder.


#### Tell git what's your repository url to pull and push commits

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/my_first_repository
git remote set-url origin https://githubchemistry@github.com/githubchemistry/my_first_repository.git
```

Check:

```bash
git remote -v
```


#### Make a change to the `README.md` file using your favourite text editor

- In your Desktop, go the cloned folder and open `README.md` with a text editor, e.g. TextEdit.
- Change the file, e.g. add a new line "This is my second line of script" and save changes.
- Check how changes are tracked by Git:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/my_first_repository
git status
```

Now the status of `README.md` is modified.


#### Stage and commit the change

Staging:

```bash
git add README.md
git status
```

Committing:

```bash
git commit -a -m "My second update"
git status
```

#### Push changes to your online GitHub repository

```bash
git push origin master
```

Now check that your change to `README.md` made to your online GitHub repository.

Bonus points:

- Make another change to `README.md` using the online GitHub repository and pull the change to your local repository (Hint: `git pull`).

Done!
